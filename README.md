# cityGuideApp

### City guide app is a Software Engineering lesson project that require some use cases to implement them. These are the details:

You are asked to develop a system that helps tourists and locals to explore the city. It is preferred to
be multilingual. The system should offer functionalities such as:

- Purchasing the public transport card for the city

Just one use cases wanted to implement. This is **_locating the user and giving information about nearby attractions._**

In this project hybrid architectural model is used. Hybrid Model is consist of 2 design pattern.
1. Repository Pattern
2. MVVM Pattern

In addition lots of sofware engineering concepts in there:
- UI Design Principles
  - Be consistent.
  - Easy to understand.
  - Easy to learn.
  - Don't use more than 4 color.
  - Avoid over use of color.
  - Navigate user being gentle and nice.
  - Give error message being kind, clear, consistent and constructive.
- Test
  - Unit testing
  - System testing
